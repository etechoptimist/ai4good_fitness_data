This repository analyses the data provided by Google Fit from my personal wearable. The purpose is to use Machine Learning for Physical Activity Recognition.


Physical Activity Recognition (PAR) involves the automatic detection of physical activities performed by humans, while PAR analytics focuses on extracting knowledge from these detected activities by discovering and learning patterns. PAR analytics has broad applications in fields such as security, entertainment, sports, fitness, and health monitoring. Traditional machine learning methods have been widely used in PAR, but deep learning has introduced new possibilities. However, Physical Activity Forecasting (PAF) remains underexplored in this domain.

Potential PAF applications include:

- Nutrition management: PAF can be used to monitor daily physical activity and calorie intake, enabling the creation of personalized diets to help maintain a healthy weight and reduce risks of chronic diseases.

- Early dementia diagnosis: PAF can detect early signs of dementia by monitoring changes in mobility, aiding in the early diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

- Depression detection: By tracking decreases in physical activity, PAF can assist in the early identification of depression in both young and elderly individuals.
